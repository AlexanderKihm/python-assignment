# By running "calculate_pi_MC.py", a graphical output will be generated illustrating the stochastic computation of pi for various sample sizes. This procedure is also known as Monte Carlo simulation.
# Sample sizes can easily be adjusted in the .txt-file as integer variables (one per line). If no .txt-file is provided or it is faulty, default sample sizes will be used instead.
